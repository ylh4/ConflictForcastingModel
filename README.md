# Conflict Forecasting Model

# Goal: Forecasting the onset of Communal Conflict in the Horn of Africa
### By: Yared Hurisa

## Overview

Armed conflicts that occur between one or more armed groups, such as government or non-government forces, are the cause of death and displacement in many countries. By the end of 2019, nearly 80 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide due to armed conflict (Amnesty International, 2020).
Appropriate early-warning systems that can meaningfully forecast the conflict in its various forms are important tools in responding to the crisis ahead of time. This will have a significant impact on reducing the devastating consequence of conflict, including loss of life, livelihoods, and infrastructure.

Armed conflict is a pervasive problem in East African countries such as South Sudan and Ethiopia due to a range of issues. Conflict is typically heightened by elections, the implementation of controversial land tenure policies, federalism, state use of force, and the unintended effects of public and private investments in the horn of Africa.  As a result, millions of people have been displaced and died in addition to the immeasurable economic losses incurred due to the conflict.

Appropriate early-warning systems that can meaningfully predict the onset of communal conflict are important to respond to the crisis ahead of time. This will have a significant impact on reducing the devastating consequence of conflict in terms of loss of lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.

This project was done in fulfillment of the 2020 summer data science fellowship at The Data Incubator. The assignment included a web application using flask and Heroku which can be accessed here: `conflictforecastingmodel.herokuapp.com`
