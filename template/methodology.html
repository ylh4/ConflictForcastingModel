<h1>Model Description</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Our objective here is to estimate the standard functional form of:
  
    <img src="/static/Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 10.27.04 AM.png" alt="">
   
</p>
<p>Where, yi, t+1 is a binary output representing future onset of 
    conflict at the subnational level (1, conflict; 0,no conflict)
     as a function of yi, t-k ; previous onset of conflict, xi, t-k ;
      dynamic input variables in the past; si, static input variables 
      such as location reference and f(.) is the prediction function 
      learned by the model. </p>
         
<p>The conflict data has to destinict features that requires special care compared
  to conventional machine learning problems.
  These are class imbalance and recurrence. </p>
 
<h3>Class imbalance</h3>
<p>In reality, conflict occurs in a rare like situation resulting in 
    a significant class imbalance in the output data between 
    conflict and non-conflict events. As can be seen from the 
    following chart, overall, the percent of postive records for conflict
    is less than 10 percent for most of the years except for the last 
    five years. This requires a mechanism that can take into account
    for the less number of postive(conflict) records in the dataset.

               var spec = '/static/c_onset_1.json';
               vegaEmbed("#id1", spec);
       
            </script>
<h3>Reccurance of conflict</h3>
<div class="class2">
    <div id = "id2"></div> <div id = "pred"></div> </div>
       <script>
           var spec = '/static/c_prob.json';
           vegaEmbed("#id2", spec);

<h3>EasyEnsemble Classifier</h3> 
<p>Undersampling is among the popular methods of handling 
    class-imbalance.  This method entails taking a subset of the 
    major class to train the classifier. However, this method has 
    a main deficiency as it ignores portions of the dataset in an 
    attempt to balance the output records. </p>

<p>Xu-Ying, Jianxin, and Zhi-Hua (2080), proposed EasyEnsemble classifier
    to overcome the above deficiency of under sampling. The idea of 
    EasyEnsemble forecast samples several subsets from the majority 
    class and combines for a final decision. These independent 
    amples ultimately take into account the different aspects of the 
    entire dataset.
