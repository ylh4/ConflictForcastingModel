<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> Armed conflict is pervasive in East African countries such as 
    South Sudan and Ethiopia due to a range of reasons. 
    Conflict also among groups with different 
    ethnicity, religion, region, or livelihood backgrounds which is typically heightened by-elections, 
    the implementation of controversial land tenure policies, federalism,  
    state use of force, and the unintended effects of public and private 
    investments in the horn of Africa.  As a result, people are killed and displacement 
    happens in mass due to conflict. Conflict also has a direct economic consewuences such us 
    destruction of infrastructure, uncertainity indoing business, and increased military 
    spending (ADB, 2018).
    </p>
<p>Appropriate early-warning systems that can meaningfully predict the onset of 
    conflict is important to respond to crisis ahead of time. This will have a 
    significant impact on reducing the devastating consequence of conflict 
    in terms of loss of lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to allow users to forecast the onset of conflict in Ethiopia
    at subnational level and on monthly basis one year ahead of time.</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>   
<p>Our modeling work involves the use of conflict as an 
    outcome variable extracted from the ACLED dataset. The ACLED 
    project tracks armed conflict events on a real-time basis. Our model 
    forecasts conflict in Ethiopia at the admin2/zoneal level as well as one 
    year ahead of time and on a monthly basis.
</p>
<p>To this end, the onset of conflict (cc_onset) is defined as a binary 
    output variable representing 1, the presence of conflict; 0, 
    otherwise. 
</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2> 
<p>Below, we describe the list of input variables used in the model and 
    their brief description.</p>
